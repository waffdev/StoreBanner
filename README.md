# Store Banner

This mod simply allows you to add any PNG file to create a banner for your store, making things look pretty! It is recommended for the banner to have a resolution of 800 x 100.

## Installation

* Install ![Tobey's BepInEx x MelonLoader Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/supermarketsimulator/mods/9) for Supermarket Simulator
* Extract the "StoreBanner.zip" file in your Downloads
* Copy ALL contents of this folder into your "BepInEx\Plugins" folder in your game directory (Both the DLL and the folder)
* Start up the game and enjoy!


## Changing the Banner

Inside the StoreBanner folder in "BepInEx\plugins" is a file called "texBanner.png" This is the file you want to replace

As mentioned above, it is recommended for the resolution to be 800 x 100 pixels for the best look in game. As long as you do not change the name or file format of the image, it will work just fine! :D

I have also put a template.psd Photoshop file in the folder which has a grime texture on it to make it look a little less flat if you wish to use it.
